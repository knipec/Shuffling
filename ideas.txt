IDEAS:

--------- SHUFFLEDNESS ANALYSIS ---------
- Count number of inversions
- Count number of movements/swaps to being sorted
	- Either more swaps is more "shuffled"
	- Or you do it the same as inversions, where you find the probability of a permutation needing that many swaps (works better for backwards not being "super random")
	- http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13549051/find-the-number-of-swaps-needed-to-sort-a-given-array
- Maybe average or min of the two?
- (TRY THIS NEXT?) Find length and number of chunks of:
	- Numbers incrementing or decrementing by 1
	- Increasing/decreasing numbers


----------- WAYS OF SHUFFLING -----------
- Riffle
- Overhand
- k-Pile



------------- VISUALIZATION -------------
- Color 
- Height of bar (like sorting visualizations)
- Slope (like that one card shuffling vis)
